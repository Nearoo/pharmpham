#### Clean the affected area with a mild soap.

If the area where you’ll be applying the povidone is difficult to rinse in a sink, sponge bathe the area. All visible dirt should be removed from the area before applying the povidone. Dry the area with a clean towel afterwards.

#### Apply a small amount of povidone to clean the affected area.

In most situations, a small amount of povidone will be more than enough to cover the area. Depending on the size of the affected area and the instructions you're given, pour the solution, or use a dropper or cotton ball or swab.
According to your preference, you can leave the area uncovered or cover it with a sterile bandage.
Povidone solutions have a tendency to stain the skin a yellow-orange color. Even if a bandage isn’t necessary, it can be useful for hiding povidone stains.

#### Keep an eye out for allergic reactions.

The most common side effect of using povidone is minor skin irritation. If this irritation persists for an extended period of time or worsens in severity, speak with your doctor. If you have any severe allergic reactions, like rashes, hives, itching, or swelling, see a doctor immediately.
Povidone allergies are somewhat rare, but not unheard of. Take a moment to look at the allergy symptoms listed on label or in the instructions.[4]
Povidone should be stored at room temperature, away from light, heat, and moisture.
